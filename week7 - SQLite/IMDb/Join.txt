## JOIN
## allows to join tables together

    ## for example: get all the Steve Carell's TV Shows
        ## Find Steve's id
        ## SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = "Steve Carell";
        
        ## Find all id's of shows made by Steve Carell
        ## SELECT show_id FROM stars WHERE person_id = (SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = "Steve Carell");
        
        ## Find all titles of all id's shows made by Steve Carell
        ## SELECT title FROM shows WHERE id IN (SELECT show_id FROM stars WHERE person_id = (SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = "Steve Carell"));
        
## Another way to acheive the same result is to use the JOIN keyword
    ## SELECT title FROM people
    ## JOIN stars ON people.id = stars.person_id
    ## JOIN shows ON stars.show_id = shows.id
    ## WHERE name = "Steve Carell";
    
## JOIN can be speed up using the indexes
## Run this with .timer ON to see the difference

    ## CREATE INDEX person_index ON stars (person_id);
    ## CREATE INDEX show_index ON stars (show_id);
    ## CREATE INDEX name_index ON people (name);
    
    ## SELECT title FROM people
    ## JOIN stars ON people.id = stars.person_id
    ## JOIN shows ON stars.show_id = shows.id
    ## WHERE name = "Steve Carell";
